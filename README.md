Delivery Optimization Project
Project Overview
Client: - Largest last mile delivery service in Nigeria

Challenge: Address the sub-optimal placement of motorbike drivers (pilots) and clients, leading to a high number of unfulfilled delivery requests.

Objective: Understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests and recommend optimal driver locations to increase the fraction of completed orders, improving client satisfaction and business growth.

Business Need
Gokada Works, partnered with motorbike owners and drivers, delivers parcels across Lagos, Nigeria. With over a million deliveries and a fleet of 1200+ riders, Ada faces challenges in driver and client placement, resulting in many unfulfilled delivery requests. As drivers are paid based on accepted requests, optimizing driver locations is crucial for enhancing client satisfaction and business growth.

Proposed Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering
2. Infer and Validate Causal Graph
3. Perform Causal Inference using Pearlâ€™s Framework

EDA Report: Insights and visualizations from the exploratory data analysis.
Feature Engineering Documentation: Description of engineered features and their relevance.
Causal Graph: Inferred and validated causal graph.
Causal Inference Report: Results from the causal inference task, including key findings and recommendations.


Solution Benefits
- Increased Client Satisfaction: By optimizing driver locations, more delivery requests will be fulfilled, leading to happier clients.
- Business Growth: Improved delivery fulfillment rates will boost Ada's reputation and business volume.
- Driver Earnings: Optimizing driver locations ensures more accepted requests, enhancing drivers' earnings.
